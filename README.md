From the list of offers, the project manager can accept or reject an offer, specifying a rejection reason.
A logged in project manager can see all the projects a sponsor invested in, his contact information, by selecting the sponsor from the list of offers. 

## Sponsor
A sponsor needs to login into the application where he will be able to see a list with all the projects. The list should be searchable by the projectâ€™s name.
A logged in sponsor can also see all the projects created by a specific project manager, the contact information provided by him, by selecting the project manager from the description of the project.
Also, logged in sponsor can select to invest into a project (if the offer is accepted by the project manager), and retract the offer(from a list of offers).
